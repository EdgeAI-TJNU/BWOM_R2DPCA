**Experimental code for the paper _'Robust Two Dimensional Principal Component Analysis via Binary Weighting and Optimal Mean Estimation'_**


The code implements a robust two-dimensional principal component analysis algorithm based on binary weighting and optimal mean estimation. For more details, please refer to the paper titled "Robust Two-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis via Binary Weighting and Optimal Mean Estimation."

The datasets folder contains the datasets used in the paper, including ETH-80, NEC, COIL-100, ORL, GT, and PIE. Within it, the train and test folders hold the training and testing samples, respectively. The subfolders 20, 40, and 60 contain training samples with 20%, 40%, and 60% random noise occlusion added artificially. The train.txt and test.txt files serve as sample labels for validating the model's performance.
